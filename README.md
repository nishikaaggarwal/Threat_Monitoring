# Threat_Monitoring
Problem Statement
In highly secure defense networks, not all threats come from outside.

Insiders — trusted users like employees, interns, or contractors — may:
Access unauthorized files or systems
Download or modify sensitive data
Misuse privileges intentionally or accidentally
Exfiltrate confidential documents

Goal: Detect these risks before damage is done.

Solution: This Project
You're simulating an Insider Threat Monitoring System that uses:

✅ Real-time User Behavior Analysis (UBA)
✅ Rule-based + ML-based anomaly detection (Hybrid)
✅ FastAPI-powered backend
✅ Dashboard to visualize threat activity

Why It’s Useful to DRDO
* Defense data is extremely sensitive
* Malicious insiders are hard to detect manually
* Traditional access control is static, but behavior is dynamic
* Combines AI + rules + visualization = next-gen detection

You can scale it up to:
Use real-time logs (SIEM tools, ELK, etc.)
Add user authentication + session tracking
Store threats to a secure backend
Auto-alert security officers
